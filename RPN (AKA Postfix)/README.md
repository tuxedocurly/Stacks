"RPN", "Reverse Polish Notation" or "postfix" form, is a mathematical expression where operators ("+" addition, "-" subtraction, "" multiplication, "/" division) come after (postfix) the operands they work on.

Examples:

2 3 +               add 2 and 3, yielding 5
2 3 + 4 *           add 2 and 3, yielding 5, then multiply it by 4, yielding 20
2 1 -               subtract 1 from 2 (2 - 1) yielding 1
1 2 -               subtract 2 from 1, yielding -1
